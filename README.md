## uniswap_market_impact

Some scripts to calculate the swap quantities required for a specific amount of price impact in a Uniswap V2 pool.

See `README.pdf` for an explanation of the calculations required.

See `main.py` for an example calculation.

Note, this repository requires a `.env` file of the format:

```
POOL = 'UNISWAP_V2_POOL_ON_ETHEREUM'
ETHERSCAN_TOKEN = 'ETHERSCAN_API_KEY'
```
